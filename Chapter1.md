# Chapter 1: Introduction

In chapter one, I need to deliver a clear and detailed explanation of the problem background, the proposed solution, the project importance, objectives, and scope.


## Problem Background

The problem background of my project is that Privilege Escalation skills don't receive enough attention when it comes to offensive security training neither from entities providing the training nor the trainees seeking it.

## Proposed Solution

The solution I thought made sense is to have a training platform that specializes in Privilege Escalation. Especially that someone who is skilled in getting initial access doesn't have to be skilled in performing privilege escalation and vice-versa.

## Project Objectives

The project objectives were:
1. To study the technologies needed (Docker, Virtual Machines, Web Development, and Privilege Escalation Techniques)
2. To design, develop and integrate system elements (Docker Images, Web Application, Virtual Machine)
3. To test the system for correctness, usability, and acceptance.

## Project Scope

The project Scope was:

1. It solely focused on privilege escalation
2. One (1) Linux virtual machine.
3. Three (3) Linux privileges escalation scenarios.
4. Three (3) Linux Docker images.
5. One (1) web interface.


## Chapter 1 Discussion

After preparing chapter one it was time to receive my supervisor's comments about it. Miss Hazinah suggested some corrections that I have tackled. And it was the time that I realized to run a grammar checker.
