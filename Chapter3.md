# Chapter 3: Development Methodology

In this chapter I had to make a choice about which software development methodology I'm going to use to build the system. I need to justify my choice and describe the phases of the methodology.

## Methodology Choice

In order to make a reasonable choice about the development methodology I'm going to use, I had to read a lot and do some research about most of the software development methodologies there are.

I noticed that one methodology seemed to be exactly what I needed. This was the [Iterative and Incremental Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) methodology.

This methodology is centered around dividing the system into multiple components that can be developed independently from each other. Well, the system I'm proposing is exactly that. The system components are as follows:

1. Docker Images
2. Web Application
3. Virtual Machine


 Docker images that have pre-configured environments of privilege escalation training scenarios, until here that could be the project, no additions needed. The second component is a web application to interact with those docker images, instead of the user having to configure docker on their machine and run every docker image manually, a web application where this can be controlled and done automatically would be nice. The third component is the actual virtual machine to package up both the previous components together in one portable system that can be easily deployed.

## Methodology Justification

My justification for the choice of this methodology was that it just met my needs and it was the most suitable one for my project in my opinion. After consulting my supervisor and explaining my point, she encouraged me to go for it.

## Methodology Phases:

The phases in this methodology are 5 general phases. The 4th phase is an iterative phase that actually contains 4 subphases to be done iteratively for each increment.

The phases are as follows:

* P1: Requirements Definition
* P2: Requirements Assignment to Increments
* P3: System Architecture Design
* P4.1: Increment Development
* P4.2: Increment Validation
* P4.3: Increment Integration
* P4.4: System Validation
* P5: System Release

## Chapter 3 Discussion

After preparing chapter 3 it was time to receive my supervisorâ€™s comments and suggestions about it. I have received a number of corrections regarding figures citation that was corrected later. And hence the completion of chapter 3.
