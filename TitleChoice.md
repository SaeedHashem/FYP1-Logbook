## Project Topic Decision

At first, I had to project topics in mind:
1. GraphQL Security (Research)
2. Privilege Escalation Focused Training Platform (Development)

After discussion with my supervisor Miss Hazinah, I realized that doing a development project is more suitable to the way I like to do things. So I decided to go therough with the development project of a privilege escalation focused training platform.


## Title Choice

The initial title was decided by me with the help of my supervisor during the project proposal, it was "Training Platform for Offensive Security Professionals Focused on Privilege Escalation". However, this title had some comments from the evaluators during the project proposal presentation.

##  What's next?

After deciding the project title I will have to start shaping the idea and deciding the project objectives and scope. This is to make the idea representable on the project proposal presentation day.
